# ankicardsios

Project in which i'll create an ios app which is an ankicards app.
Initially thought about doing it in Phyton using Vivy Framework, but not sure anymore about it.
Might start learning Swift, but even so, i still can't upload it to the AppStore..
So it's just a project to learn new things.
